    "**Prototype: Real-Time Energy Consumption Tracker**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "This prototype simulates real-time energy consumption monitoring for household devices. It is intended to demonstrate basic stream processing capabilities, data aggregation, and simple visualization as a foundation for more complex energy monitoring systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "As energy consumption increases and sustainability becomes a priority, there is a growing need for real-time energy usage tracking at the device level. This prototype aims to provide a lightweight framework to simulate and visualize such usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Design Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Generator:** Simulates device usage values between 50–500W at 1-second intervals.\n",
    "* **Aggregator:** Maintains cumulative usage totals.\n",
    "* **Visualizer:** Updates a bar chart of total usage over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Technology Stack**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Python`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `Counter` from `collections`\n",

    "## **5. Code Summary**\n",
    "\n",

    "## **6. Design Decisions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Streaming via Generator:** Simulates continuous data input instead of batch processing.\n",
    "* **Bar Chart for Visualization:** Chosen for its simplicity and clarity in showing totals.\n",
    "* **`Counter` Used for Aggregation:** Efficient for frequency-style data and summing.\n",

    "| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| Use of `matplotlib`   | Quick, flexible            | Not optimal for high-speed real-time charts             |\n",
    "| In-memory aggregation | Simple, no database needed | Doesn’t scale for large or long-running streams         |\n",
    "| 1-second interval     | Easy to visualize          | Not configurable, fixed-rate limits testing flexibility |\n",

    "## **8. Future Work**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add persistent storage (e.g., SQLite or AWS Timestream)\n",
    "* Support for real-time dashboards (e.g., `Plotly Dash`, `Bokeh`)\n",
    "* Device normalization based on power rating\n",
    "* Extend to IoT device ingestion via MQTT or Kinesis\n",

    "## **9. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This prototype demonstrates a foundation for real-time energy usage tracking, simulating live data and aggregating it for analysis. Future iterations should explore persistence, scale, and richer visualizations to align with production readiness.\n",
